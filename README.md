# ShelvesClient

## A client/server project management system for small, loosely-organized projects

Created by Connor Dufault in 2020

This is the client component of the Shelves project. It connects with the [server application](https://github.com/cjdufault/ShelvesServer). A GUI is provided to the user that allows for viewing tasks from the server. If the user has authenticated with the server's admin password, they can also add, edit, and delete tasks. The admin password can be set only by the server application.
